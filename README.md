### Hi â€” I'm a Frontend Engineer ðŸ‘‹

Meta-certified. Software Engineering grad. I turn polished designs into fast, accessible web apps that people enjoy using.

I focus on production-ready UI: thoughtful interactions, predictable performance, and clean, maintainable code. I collaborate closely with designers and product teams to ship features that matter.

#### What I build
- **Design â†’ code:** pixel-perfect, component-driven interfaces  
- **Fast & accessible:** experiences that perform and scale in production  
- **Pragmatic solutions:** simple, testable, and maintainable implementations
